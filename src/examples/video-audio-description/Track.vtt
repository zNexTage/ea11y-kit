00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:001.730
vile victorians

1
00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:07.760
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:08.710
Well,

3
00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:09.460
gentlemen,

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.130
certainly this is no place for a lady.

5
00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:18.969
It gives me great pleasure and no small amount of relief to declare this

6
00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:23.049
the first ever flushing public lavatory open.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.040
Well,

8
00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:28.139
I've got it now.

9
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.520
OK?

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.830
Might wanna leave it five minutes.

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.939
Oh,

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.970
my goodness.

13
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.540
A year previously,

14
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.310
in 1851 temporary toilets were exhibited at the Great exhibition in

15
00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.770
London's Hyde Park,

16
00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:57.680
and visitors were charged a penny to use them.

17
00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.689
And that is thought to be the origin of the phrase to spend a penny.

18
00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:05.250
And this is the origin of the Nobel Peace Prize.

19
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.050
Hm.

20
00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:09.199
Interesting.

21
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.300
But that's not what's supposed to happen.

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.290
Darling.

23
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.449
I don't want to worry you or anything,

24
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.459
but I think you might be dead.

25
00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:20.529
I don't think so,

26
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.059
darling.

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.150
Well,

28
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
this newspaper seems to think you aren't.

29
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:26.150
It's always been very reliable in the past.

30
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.580
Look,

31
00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:28.110
Doctor Alfred Nobel,

32
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.660
the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite,

34
00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:33.970
died yesterday in the French resort of Cannes.

35
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.610
Let me see that.

36
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.080
Good grief.

37
00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:39.199
It does say I'm dead.

38
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.459
Look what they're calling me here.

39
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.279
The Merchant of Death says here Doctor Alfred Nobel became rich by finding

40
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.940
ways to kill more people even faster than ever before.

41
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.540
Honestly,

42
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.160
by reading this,

43
00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:54.139
you'd think that just because I'd invented dynamite I am personally responsible for the death of thousands of

44
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.629
people.

45
00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.779
I mean,

46
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.419
honestly,

47
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.019
have you ever heard such nonsense?

48
00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:59.290
I said,

49
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.900
have you ever heard?

50
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.610
That's rubbish.

51
00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.790
Sophie,

52
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.879
if you have something to say Well,

53
00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.690
you you did invent what is,

54
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.639
at this point in time,

55
00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.839
the most powerful explosive on earth.

56
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.850
And it has gone on to kill thousands and thousands of people.

57
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.440
What's your point?

58
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.380
All I'm saying is you have to accept when people hear the word nobel,

59
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.639
they're always going to think of dynamite.

60
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.750
I knew I should have called it Nobel's safety powder.

61
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.380
I mean,

62
00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.470
do you really think that when I actually do go?

63
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.160
This is how I'll be remembered?

64
00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:31.179
Oh,

65
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.270
sweetheart.

66
00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:33.710
Of course it is.

67
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.119
My fury cheeked little deaf merchant.

68
00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:37.100
Well,

69
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.360
not if I can help it.

70
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.429
I shall re invent my own image.

71
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.110
What?

72
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.589
I shall use my massive fortune to establish a special prize,

73
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.919
one that rewards positive human endeavours in the pursuit of peace.

74
00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:49.990
So that when I do die,

75
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.470
I won't just be linked to explosives.

76
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.339
and I,

77
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.600
Alfred Nobel will call this special peace prize

78
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.679
prize.

79
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.309
I might,

80
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.509
darling,

81
00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.729
why don't you call it the Nobel Peace Prize?

82
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.320
I love you,

83
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.830
darling,

84
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.889
but you have absolutely no idea.

85
00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:14.889
When it comes to marketing,

86
00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.750
take certainly roofless

87
00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:22.190
rollers.
